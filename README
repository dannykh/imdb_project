IMDb rating prediction.

The purpose of this project is to study the extent to which a movie's IMDb rating could be
predicted, given the IMDb database.
To achieve this goal, the project handles all aspects starting with retrieval of the data
from IMDb, through parsing movies to numeric feature vectors up to producing regressors
trained on given movie's and comparing them.

Usage:
The project should be acquired along with a full local IMDb MySQL database.
Relevant settings should be updated in settings.py.
To create features for a movie, see instructions in movie_vector package. Once a movieVector
is created, it should be passed to vector_file_generation.py, and the latter should be activated
under instructions written there.
Finally, given new (or existing) feature vectors for all movies, proceed to learning
package to test the features by running different learning algorithms trained on them.
Detailed instructions in relevant modules.
Important : Movie class supplies an api for the database, so all simple data about movies
is easily acquired from there. More complex forms of data (like rating averages) should be
Important: MySQL MUST be running during feature generation phase, as interaction with
the db is involved in the process of creating feature vectors.
acquired directly from the database using queries. Unfortunately the database is not
well documented and somewhat hard to understand at first.

The general workflow is :
movie_vector (package) -> vector_file_generation -> learning.regressor_analysis
These modules are well documented and explained.
