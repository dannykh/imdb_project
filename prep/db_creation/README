This package is responsible for creation and upkeep of the local IMDB database.
The DB creation process is complicated and long. First there must exist a local
MySQL db created by the IMDbPY package. Then essentially only db_setup.py need be run,
however one try might result in errors, and several attempts (perhaps fine tuned) are required.

It is recommended to avoid using this package unless the user knows exactly what's going on.
Best obtain a copy of the ready database ( <2gb ).
