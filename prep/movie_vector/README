movie_vector

This package handles the transformation of a Movie object to a vector of features.
It is comprised of a base MovieVector module (abstract), and implementations of it.
movievector describes HOW to implement a transformer. All other modules in the package
are implementations, i.e concrete transformers in the format : movievector[version id],
or common util modules serving the transformers.
The motivation to this architecture is to allow multiple versions of transformers to be
developed concurrently and independently, resulting in faster and distributed movie
parsing.

To add a transformer, simply create a module named movievector[unique version id],
which has a class implementing MovieVectorGenerator class in movievector.
